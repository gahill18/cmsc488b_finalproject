* Introduction

   Targeted property based testing, or t-PBT, is a library designed to make property based testing with quickCheck produce counterexamples to defined properties more efficiently. It does so in the following steps:
   
   1. use quickCheck's arbitrary to define a starting point (users can define their own arbitrary instaces for non-prelude types)
   2. use a user-provided neighborhood function to get a list of nearby points
   3. use a user-provided utility function to search for a local min or max
   4. if the value of the local min or max violates the property you are looking for, congratulations you have a counterexample!
      otherwise, take the local min or max and repeat steps 2 through 4 until either
      a. the difference between iterations is too small to be meaningful
      b. you run out of "gas", which the user defines as the number of iterations before quitting
